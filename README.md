# RotaryFlexibleLink
The Rotary Flexible Link consists of a strain gage which is held at the clamped end of a thin stainless steel flexible link. The DC motor on the Rotary Servo Base Unit is used to rotate the flexible link from one end in the horizontal plane. The motor end of the link is instrumented with a strain gage that can detect the deflection of the tip.
